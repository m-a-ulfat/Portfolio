## WHAT I DO
*As a data analyst at one of Pakistan’s leading social organizations, I apply data science for impact-driven decisions.*
**- ✅ Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling.**  
I build analytical solutions to forecast outcomes — from loan default predictions to savings pattern analysis using supervised ML models.
🔢 Perform data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL

📊 Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, correlations, and outliers

📈 Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms (CatBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

🎯 Implement classification models for real-world use cases like loan default or tax prediction

🧠 Apply feature engineering and selection techniques to improve model accuracy

🛠 Use tools like Scikit-learn, CatBoost, and XGBoost for supervised learning tasks

📉 Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision-recall, and AUC-ROC

🌐 Deploy models via Flask for real-time web-based prediction apps

📁 Work with structured data in Excel, CSV, and relational databases

📊 Create visualizations and dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to support decision-making
